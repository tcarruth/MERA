# About this document

This is a prototype of an automatic report that describes the results of a demonstration analysis to support MSC certification.

```{r progresssetup,echo=F}

 incrate<-1/9
 incProgress(incrate)

```
 

# Performance Indicator Table

The Performance Indicator Table includes the 'Stock Status' metrics - the probabilities of each MP exceeding the limit (0.5 BMSY) and the target (BMSY) biomass levels over the short term (burnin years). Also tabulated are the 'Harvest Strategy' metrics. These are similar but are evaluated over the long term (burnin-50 years).

MPs that pass all probability thresholds are in green and those that do not are presented in red.  MPs that are  not available for use with current data are listed in black and the lacking data are listed in the last column to the right. 

```{r Ptab,echo=F,warning=F,error=F,message=F}

 Ptab_formatted_MSC(params$Ptab2,burnin=params$burnin,cols=params$MPcols,thresh=params$thresh)
 Thresh_tab_MSC(params$thresh)
 incProgress(incrate)

```

# Satisficed MPs

Probability of rebuilding is the fraction of simulations exceeding BMSY after two mean generation times. Relative yield is the yield obtained relative to the highest yield MP. 

```{r Satisficed,echo=F,warning=F,error=F,message=F,fig.width=10, fig.height=10}
Ptab_formatted_TO(params$Ptab4,burnin=params$burnin)
incProgress(incrate)

```


# Performance Trade-Off 

Long term yield (LTY) vs probability biomass is greater than half BMSY in years 11-50 (PI.1.2.1a)

```{r P3_LTY,echo=F,warning=F,error=F,message=F,fig.width=7, fig.height=7}
P3_LTY_plot(params$MSEobj_top_TO,MSEobj_reb_top_TO,MPcols=params$MPcols)
incProgress(incrate)
```

# B/BMSY and relative yield projection plots

For each MP a 50 year projection is presented showing the possible range of values for spawning biomass relative to MSY levels (B/BMSY) and yield relative to current yields. The colored region represents the 10th and 90th percentiles, the white line is the median trend and lines for two simulations are included to show the typical degree of variability within a simulation. 


```{r pencil,echo=F,warning=F,error=F,message=F,results='asis',fig.width=12, fig.height=9}
 
 nMPs<-length(params$MSEobj_top@MPs)
 panelsperplot<-8
 nplots<-ceiling(nMPs/panelsperplot)
 plots<-split(1:nMPs, ceiling(seq_along(1:nMPs)/panelsperplot))
 
 for(i in 1:length(plots)){
   MSEobj2<-Sub(params$MSEobj_top,MPs=params$MSEobj_top@MPs[unlist(plots[i])])
   Pplot3(MSEobj2,MPcols=params$MPcols[plots[[i]]],maxcol=4,maxrow=4)
 }

 
  incProgress(incrate)
```

# Rebuilding 

A second MSE was run to determine how likely management procedures are to rebuild the stock were it from low stock levels (PI 1.1.2)

The rebuilding analysis simulates the fishery currently in a depleted state even if the user-specified depletion in the operating model is higher.  In these cases, the rebuilding analysis provides added assurance whether a particular management procedure would be likely to rebuild the stock if the user-specified depletion level is overly optimistic and the stock status is more depleted in actuality, and thus in need of rebuilding.

```{r rebuild,echo=F,warning=F,error=F,message=F,results='asis',fig.width=12, fig.height=9}
 
 nMPs<-length(params$MSEobj_reb_top@MPs)
 panelsperplot<-8
 nplots<-ceiling(nMPs/panelsperplot)
 plots<-split(1:nMPs, ceiling(seq_along(1:nMPs)/panelsperplot))
 
 for(i in 1:length(plots)){
   MSEobj2<-Sub(params$MSEobj_reb_top,MPs=params$MSEobj_reb_top@MPs[unlist(plots[i])])
   Rplot(MSEobj2,MPcols=params$MPcols[plots[[i]]],maxcol=4,maxrow=4)
 }

 
incProgress(incrate)
```


# PI 1.1.1 Uncertainties 

Each MP was tested over a number of simulated fisheries. Each simulation behaves differently. In these plots it is possible to see the distribution of simulations throughout the stock status PI.1.1.1 scores. 


```{r uncertain,echo=F,warning=F,error=F,message=F,results='asis',fig.width=12, fig.height=9}
 
 MSC_uncertain(params$MSEobj_top,MPcols=params$MPcols,maxMPs=params$MSEobj_top@nMPs, LTL=F,inc_thresh = F,burnin=params$burnin)

 incProgress(incrate)

# Cost of Current Uncertainties

When answering questions in the Fishery, Management and Data panels above, you may have included more uncertainty in your answers to some questions. The Cost of Current Uncertainties analysis examines which questions are associated with the greatest veriability in long-term yield. To do this the range of values specified in each question is divided into subranges and the variance in yield is determined across among these sub-ranges. This provides a measure of which uncertainties are the largest determinants of future long term yield (ie which questions are the most important in determining performance as they were answered). 


```{r CCU1,echo=F,warning=F,error=F,message=F,include=F}
nMPs<-length(MSEobj_top@MPs)
panelsperplot<-6
nplots<-ceiling(nMPs/panelsperplot)
plots<-split(1:nMPs, ceiling(seq_along(1:nMPs)/panelsperplot))
VOIout<-new('list')
for(i in 1:length(plots)){
  #MSEobj2<-Sub(params$MSEobj_top,MPs=params$MSEobj_top@MPs[unlist(plots[i])])
  #VOIout[[i]]<-getVOI(MSEobj2)#,ncomp=17,nbins=6)[[1]]
}
incProgress(incrate)
```



```{r CCU2,echo=F,warning=F,error=F,message=F,fig.width=15, fig.height=10}


for(i in 1:length(plots)){
 # MSEobj2<-Sub(MSEobj_top,MPs=MSEobj_top@MPs[unlist(plots[i])])
  #CCU_plot(VOIout[[i]],MSEobj2,MPcols=params$MPcols,maxrow=2)
}
incProgress(incrate)

```


# MSE convergence diagnostics

Have enough simulations been carried out to interpret results? Ideally the lines in the graphs below should be flat and parallel to each other. If they are just parallel, the MP ranking may be stable but absolute MP performance is not.


```{r Converge,echo=F,warning=F,error=F,message=F,fig.width=11, fig.height=5}

Converge(MSEobj_top,PMs = list(Yield, P10),ncol=2,nrow=1)
incProgress(incrate)

```
